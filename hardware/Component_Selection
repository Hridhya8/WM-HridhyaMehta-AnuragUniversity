COMPONENT SELECTION - ENGINEERING JUSTIFICATION

VL53L1X ToF Sensor:
- Accurate depth measurement (unlike ultrasonic in trash environment)
- Works in dust, humidity, and irregular waste surfaces

STM32WL MCU:
- Integrated LoRaWAN radio → removes external module cost
- Low power sleep current → multi-year battery life

Li-SOCl₂ Battery (3.6V):
- Industrial grade, used in utility metering
- 3-5 year lifetime with deep sleep duty cycle

IP65 Enclosure:
- Protects electronics against dust/rain
- Acrylic window protects ToF optical path
